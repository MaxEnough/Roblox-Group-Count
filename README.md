Q: How do I host this?


A: The best way to host this for free is locally. You can also use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Otherwise I suggest purchasing a hosting service or VPS to keep this online 24/7. Please make sure that you are using Node.JS.


Q: It's not working?

A: You probably did something wrong, make sure you inputed everything correctly. 

-

Q: Some part of the code is erroring.


A: This is most likely because you aren't using Node.js and or NPM. My code is wrriten for [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Q: Can this be hosted on Roblox?
 
A: Roblox doesn't use JavaScript but if you want to rewrite in Lua, go for it.
